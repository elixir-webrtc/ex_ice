  Its implementation is based on sec. 7.2.5.3.4.

  The meaning of `nominate?` flag depends on the ice agent role.

  In case of controlled, it means that either we received nomination
  request on pair, or we received conn check success response for the 
  request that was triggered by the other side's conn check request 
  with use_candidate flag.

  In case of controlling side, it simply means we received conn check
  success response for our nomination request.
