Trickle ICE implementation.

RFC implemented:
* [RFC 8445](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8445)
* [RFC 8838](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8838)

## Features
* compatible both with aggressive and regular nomination
* role conflict resolution
* supports host, prflx, srflx and remote relay candidates (support for local relay candidates is planned)
* transaction pacing
* keepalives on valid and selected pairs

## Limitations
* there is always only one stream and one component -
we don't plan to add support for multiple streams and components
as WebRTC multiplexes traffic on a single socket but PRs are welcomed

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_ice, "~> 0.4.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

See our [example](https://github.com/elixir-webrtc/ex_ice/tree/master/example), 
[integration tests](https://github.com/elixir-webrtc/ex_ice/blob/master/test/integration/p2p_test.exs),
and [documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_ice/readme.html) for usage examples.

We also provide a very simple [signalling server](https://github.com/elixir-webrtc/ex_ice/tree/master/signalling_server), which can be used
to connect two ICE agents.
